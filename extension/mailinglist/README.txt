0. Introduction
***************

This extension contains a workflowevent that allows you to send mail to certain e-mailaddresses in the specified attributes of contentobjects. So it will be possible to generate a mailing list based on custom attributes in the workflow object (or based on the parent's object attributes of the workflow object).
The workflowevent also gives you the possibility to decide when you should send an email (at the time of the creation of an object or when you update a new version of it).
The email is generated by templates, you could define override templates and send out custom e-mails with a custom body for every contentclass for example.

Be careful: you should only use this event in a post publish workflow, because it needs published objects to work.

2. Installation & configuration
*******************************

This workflowevent should be easy to install if you follow these steps

	1)  extract the contents of the archive into your eZ Publish extension directory

	2)  Create/Modify settings/override/site.ini.append.php and add the following lines
	
		[ExtensionSettings]
		ActiveExtensions[]=mailinglist
	    
	    If [ExtensionSettings] is already there just add the second line

	3) adjust the mailinglist.ini-settings in the settingsdirectory of the mailinglist extension

3. Using the workflowevent
**************************

When you edit the workflow and add the mailinglist-event, you'll see the following options
	
	1) Parent node or Current node
	2) New object
	3) Update of an object

Let me try to explain what these options do.

	1) if you select current node, you'll use the object in the workflow to set up the mailinglist. This means 	   that you will search the defined attributes of the content object as specified in mailinglist.ini for 	           e-mailaddresses.
	   if you select parent node, you'll use the object above the object in the workflow to set up the            mailinglist. This means that you will search the defined attributes of the parent node's object as 	   specified in mailinglist.ini.
	2) You'll send an e-mail if a new object is published
	3) You'll send an e-mail if an updated object is published
