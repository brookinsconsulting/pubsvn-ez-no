<H1><A NAME="2">2 Introduction</A></H1>
<H2><A NAME="2_1">2.1 Version</A></H2>
 This manual covers version 1.14 of JpGraph. A 2D graph plotting library
 for PHP 4.1 and above.
<P> Even though the library is known to work with version of PHP prior
 to 4.1 the libraru is not tested nor is it recommended to run with any
 older versions of PHP.</P>
<H2><A NAME="2_2">2.2 Software License</A></H2>
 JpGraph 1.x is released under a dual license QPL 1.0 (Qt-License) for
 non-commercial (including educational) use of the library and the
 JpGraph Professional License for commercial use.
<H2><A NAME="2_3">2.3 JpGraph Features</A></H2>
 This is a truly OO graph library which makes it easy to both draw a
 &quot;quick and dirty&quot; graph with a minimum of code and quite complex graphs
 which requires a very fine grain of control. The library tries to
 assign sensible default values for most parameters hence making the
 learning curve quite flat since for most of the time very few commands
 is required to draw graphs with a pleasing esthetical look.
<P> Some highlights of available features are</P>
<UL>
<LI> Flexible scales, supports text-lin, text-log, lin-lin, lin-log,
 log-lin and log-log and integer scales.</LI>
<LI> Supports both PNG, GIF and JPG graphic formats. Note that the
 available formats are dependent on the specific PHP installation where
 the library is used.</LI>
<LI>Supports caching of generated graphs to lessen burden of a HTTP
 server.</LI>
<LI> Supports batch mode to only generate images to a file</LI>
<LI>Supports client side image maps which makes it easy to produce drill
 down images.</LI>
<LI>Intelligent autoscaling which gravitates towards esthetical values,
 i.e. multiples of 2:s and 5:s</LI>
<LI>Fully supports manual scaling, with fine grain control of position
 of ticks.</LI>
<LI>Supports background images with different formatting options</LI>
<LI>Supports color and brightness adjustments of images directly in PHP.</LI>
<LI>User specified grace for autoscaling</LI>
<LI> Supports up to two different y-scale, it is possible to have
 different left and right y-scale and add plots to both</LI>
<LI>Supports, line-plots, filled line-plots, accumulated line-plots, bar
 plots, accumulated bar plots, grouped bar plots, error plots, line
 error plots, scatter plots, gantt-charts, radar plots, 2D and 3D pie
 charts.</LI>
<LI>Supports unlimited number of plots in each graph, makes it easy to
 compose complex graph which consists of several plot types</LI>
<LI>User specified position of axis</LI>
<LI>Supports color gradient fill in seven styles</LI>
<LI>Designed as a flexible OO framework which makes it easy to add new
 types of plots</LI>
<LI>Supports automatic legend generation</LI>
<LI>Supports both vertical and horizontal grids</LI>
<LI>Supports anti-alising of lines</LI>
<LI>Supports background images as well as unlimited number of icons in
 the graph</LI>
<LI>Supports rotation of linear graphs</LI>
<LI>More then 400 named colors</LI>
<LI>Designed modularly - you don't have to include code which isn't used</LI>
<LI> ...and many many more features</LI>
</UL>
 In addition to these high level features the library has been designed
 to be orthogonal and very coherent in its' naming convention. For
 example, to specify color each object (i.e. axis, grids, texts, titles
 etc) within the graph implements the method SetColor() with the same
 signature.
<H2><A NAME="2_4">2.4  Getting the latest version</A></H2>
 The latest version of jpgraph can always be found on<A href="http://www.aditus.nu/jpgraph/">
 http://www.aditus.nu/jpgraph/</A>
<P> The current version as of this writing is 1.14</P>
<P> Note. I keep a straitforward version scheme to avoid the version
 number inflation. This means</P>
<UL>
<LI>1.x -&gt; 1.x.1, Bug fix release for version 1.x</LI>
<LI>1.x -&gt; 1.(x+1), Added functionality. Mostly keeping backwards
 compatibility unless a very good reason not to. All SC breaks will be
 well announced in release notes and might be small things like a
 misspelled method name compared to the proper english spelling.</LI>
<LI>1.x -&gt; 2.0, Substantially new functionality which might break
 backward compatibility</LI>
</UL>
<H2><A NAME="2_5">2.5 Planned future addition</A></H2>
 All the following features, which have not been marked as tentatively,
 will be added. The timeframe for these versions are:
<UL>
<LI> Version 2.0, (Q4 2004) Adapted for PHP 5</LI>
</UL>
 For the latest upate on planned future version see the web-site for
 JpGraph at http://www.aditus.nu/jpgraph/
<H2><A NAME="2_6">2.6 Known bugs and omissions</A></H2>

<LI>Background images does not work as expected for rotated graphs</LI>

<H2><A NAME="2_7">2.7  Acknowledgements</A></H2>
 The idea for writing this library grew out of my own needs for a high
 quality graph drawing library for PHP4. Before reinventing the wheel I
 searched the net to see if there where anything already available that
 would meet my needs. When searching I found three other PHP graph
 plotting libraries:
<OL>
<LI> &quot;chart 0.3&quot; http://quimby.gnus.org/circus/chart/chart-0.3.tar.gz,
 by Lars Magne Ingebrigtsen</LI>
<LI> &quot;ykcee.php&quot;, http://ykcee.sourceforge.net</LI>
<LI> &quot;phplot.php&quot;, http://www.phplot.com</LI>
</OL>
 All these libraries implements some fine graphic features but
 unfortunately none of those completely fulfilled our needs either for
 available functionality (for example none of these supported both two
 Y-scales, auto-scaling, and logarithmic scales), or general
 flexibility, I especially needed the option of two Y-scales, which none
 of the above packages supported. My own preference for design was
 closest to &quot;chart 0.3&quot; so I started by fixing some small bugs in that
 package and adding some new features. However I soon realized that to
 add all the features and flexibility I wanted to &quot;chart 0.3&quot; it would
 require a complete rewrite since the original design wasn't flexible
 enough, especially adding a second Y-scale would require a more
 flexible OO architecture. Since at the time I was also interested in
 giving PHP a try to see how well it would support a fully object
 oriented design so I started designing this library. The library is
 completely written from scratch but I have taken some ideas, especially
 the caching feature from &quot;chart 0.3&quot; and implemented this. I'm
 therefore thankful for those ideas. Any bugs and faults within the code
 are completely my own.
<H2><A NAME="2_8">2.8 A note on Implementing an OO library in PHP4</A></H2>
 In terms of OO support PHP is still at loss to Java, Eiffel or C++ but
 since it always been my view that OO design is more a state of mind
 then of implementation details it is still possible to arrive with a
 decent OO design even in PHP. One of the big obstacles is probably the
 very different assigning semantics used by PHP as compared to other OO
 languages since it is always copies of the object that is passed around
 by default and not references. This took some time for me personally to
 get used to (giving my own background in OO design in Java, Eiffel and
 C++). There is also a bug (present in all versions &lt;=4.04pl1) that
 makes it impossible to use a reference to the '$this' pointer in the
 constructor. This has an easy workaround by adding an extra method, say
 Init(), which is called immediately after the constructor and may
 safely use a reference to '$this' pointer. As an example of JpGraph's
 OO features this is, to my knowledge, the only piece of PHP code to
 fully implement the Observer pattern.
<H2><A NAME="2_9">2.9 Reporting bugs and suggesting improvements</A></H2>
 Bug reports and suggestions are always welcome. I only ask you to make
 sure that you read the requirements and the FAQ before submitting bugs
 and making sure you have an up to date version of PHP4, the necessary
 graphic libraries etc. I will unfortunately not be able to answer
 standard OO or PHP4 questions. Neither do I have the time to give
 PHP/GD/TTF/Apache installation support. Please see the corresponding
 documentation and relevant FAQ. I simply don't have the bandwith to
 help with these kinds of installations. Please note that this library
 will not work with versions prior to PHP4.02. Bug reports and
 suggestions should be sent to jpgraph@aditus.nu<HR>
