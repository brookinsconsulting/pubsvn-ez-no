Installing XML text toolbar extension
====================================

1. Copy the package into the `extension' directory in the root of your eZ publish installation.

2. Unpack the files in the distribution. The command necessary is depends on the file you 
   downloaded.
   [tar.gz]:
   $ tar -zxvf ezxmltoolbar-extension-1.0.tar.gz
   [bz2]:
   $ tar -jxvf ezxmltoolbar-extension-1.0.bz2
   [zip]:
   $ unzip ezxmltoolbar-extension-1.0.zip

3. We must now enable the extension in eZ publish. To do this edit site.ini.append(.php) in the 
   folder root_of_ezpublish/settings. If this file does not exist; create it. Locate (or add)
   the block [ExtensionSettings] and add the line:

   ActiveExtensions[]=ezxmltoolbar

   If you run several sites using only one distribution and only some of the sites should use
   the extension, make the changes in the override file of that siteaccess. 
   E.g root_of_ezpublish/settings/siteaccess/news/site.ini.append(.php)
   But instead of using ActiveExtensions you must add these lines instead:

   [ExtensionSettings]
   ActiveAccessExtensions[]=ezxmltoolbar


Initializing database
=====================

1. Manual install
   --------------

   o  Initialize schema

     The schema must now be created with all the tables, sequences and
     triggers for eZ Publish. Then the schema must be filled with data.

     You can start by insert the schema for the extension and then filling it
     with the basic data.

     o  Create the schema
        $ ./bin/php/ezsqlinsertschema.php --type=<dbtype> --user=<user> \
            --password=<password> --host=<hostname> \
            share/db_schema.dba <dbname>

     o  Insert data
        $ ./bin/php/ezsqlinsertschema.php --type=<dbtype> --user=<user> \
            --password=<password> --host=<hostname> \
