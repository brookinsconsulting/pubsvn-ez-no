<H2><A NAME="6_13">6.13 Adding arbitrary text strings to the graph</A></H2>
 To add clarification or other information text strings to the graph you
 can add arbitrary lines of text anywhere you like onto the graph. The
 text might have multiple lines and you can shoose the paragraph
 alignment.
<P> To add text you have to create one or more instances of the<A href="../ref/Text.html#_C_TEXT">
 Text()</A> object and then add the text object to the graph with the<A href="../ref/Graph.html#_GRAPH_ADDTEXT">
 AddText()</A> method.</P>
<P> The position of these text boxes are given as fraction of the width
 and height of the graph. When you are positioning these text boxes you
 migt also choose what part of the text box should be considered the
 anchor point for the position you specify.</P>
<P> By default the anchor point is the upper left corner of the bounding
 box for the text.</P>
<P> To show some ways of positioning the text we use a very simple bar
 graph not to distact from the text. We first just add a single text
 line with most of the settings their default value by adding the
 following lines to the graph
<BR> &nbsp;
<BR><DIV style="background-color:#E6E6E6;font-family:courier new;font-size:85%;font-weight:bold;">
<B><CODE><FONT color="#000000"> $txt=new Text(&quot;This is a text&quot;);
<BR />$txt-&gt;Pos(0,0);
<BR />$txt-&gt;SetColor(&quot;red&quot;);
<BR />$graph-&gt;AddText($txt);</FONT></CODE></B></DIV></P>
<P> The result is shown below.</P>
<P><DIV align="center">

</DIV></P>
<P>Not too exiting. Let's make it more interesting by having a
 background color, using larger fonts and framing the text box and
 adding a drop shadow to the text box by using the methods<A href="../ref/Text.html#_TEXT_SETBOX">
 SetBox()</A> and<A href="../ref/Text.html#_TEXT_SETSHADOW"> SetBox()</A>
</P>

<P> That's better. Now we get some attention. If you want to add a text
 with several lines you just need to separate the lines with a newline
 ('\n' character). The default paragraph alignment is left edge but you
 can also use right and center alignment.</P>
<P> As an illustration let's add a couple of more lines to the previous
 text, center the text box in the middle of the graph and also use
 centered paragraph alignment for the text. To adjust the paragarph
 alignemtn of the text you have to use the<A href="../ref/Text.html#_TEXT_PARAGRAPHALIGN">
 Text::ParagraphAlign()</A></P>
<P><DIV align="center">

</SMALL></DIV></P>
<P> Of course there is no limit to the number of text string you can add
 to the graph.</P>
<P> From version 1.12 it is also possible to add text strings to a graph
 using the scale coordinates instead. This is accomplished by using the<A
href="../ref/Text.html#_TEXT_SETSCALEPOS"> Text::SetScalePos()</A> Which
 is completely analogue to SetPos() with the only difference that the
 positions given are interpretated as scale values instead of fractions
 of the width and height.</P>
<H2><A NAME="6_14">6.14 Adding titles and footers to the Graph</A></H2>
 Each graph can have up to three differenet titles accessed by the three
 properties
<OL>
<LI> title</LI>
<LI> subtitle</LI>
<LI> subsubtitle</LI>
</OL>
 All of these three properties is a standard text object which means
 that you can have individual font, colors, margins and sizes of these
 tree titles.
<P> The only thing you need to think of is that you probably want to add
 some extra margin to make room for the titles (using<A href="../ref/Graph.html#_GRAPH_SETMARGIN">
 Graph::SetMargin()</A> )</P>
<P> The individual positioning of these titles are done automatically
 and will adjust to the font size beeing used.</P>
<P> If you for, aesthetic reasons, would like increase the distance from
 the top where the title is positioned (or the intra distance between
 title and sub title) you can use the<A href="../ref/Text.html#_TEXT_SETMARGIN">
 Text::SetMargin()</A> method. For example the line</P>
<P>
<BR> &nbsp;
<BR><DIV style="background-color:#E6E6E6;font-family:courier new;font-size:85%;font-weight:bold;">
<B><CODE><FONT color="#000000"> $graph-&gt;title-&gt;SetMargin(20);</FONT></CODE>
</B></DIV></P>
<P> will set the distance between the top of the title string and the
 top of the graph to 20 pixels. If you instead call the SetMargin()
 method for the subtitle it will adjust the distance between the top of
 the subtitle and the bottom of the title.</P>
<P> The titles will be positioned at the top and be centered in the
 graph. Each of these titles may have multiple lines each separated by a
 &quot;\n&quot; (newline) character. By default the paragraph alignment for each
 title is centered but may of course be changed (using the
 ParagraphAlign()) method.</P>
<P> Each graph can also have a footer. This footer is actually three
 footers. Left, center and right. The 'left' footer is aligned to the
 left, the 'center' at the bottom center and the right to the right.</P>
<P> Each of these three positions is a standard Text object which means
 you can change color, font and size as you please individually on each
 of these footer positions.</P>
<P> You access the footer through the Graph::footer property as the
 following example shows</P>
<P>

<H2><A NAME="6_15">6.15 Adding a tab title</A></H2>
 A variant of the titles is the<I> tab title</I>. This is just another
 option you have of putting a name on the graph. The apperance of this
 type is a tab on top of the plotarea with text inside.
<P> You can access the tab using the 'tabtitle' property of the graph.</P>
<P> The following figure shows an example of how this can look.</P>
<P><DIV align="center">

<P> As usual you have full freedom to specify font and colors for this
 type of title. Please see the class reference regarding<A href="../ref/GraphTabTitle.html#_C_GRAPHTABTITLE">
 GraphTabTitle()</A> for more information.</P>
<H2><A NAME="6_16">6.16 Using background images</A></H2>
 Insetad of having a single color background you can easily have an
 arbitrary image as the background. The image may be in either PNG, JPG
 or GIF format depending on what your installation supports.
<P></P>
<HR> <SMALL><STRONG> A note on GD:</STRONG> If you are using GD 2.xx you
 must make sure that the define USE_TRUECOLOR is set to true. This is
 also the default. Failure to do so in combination with GD 2.xx will
 make the background image just look like a solid black square.</SMALL>
<HR>
<P> To use a specific image as the background you just have to use the
 method<A href="../ref/Graph.html#_GRAPH_SETBACKGROUNDIMAGE">
 Graph::SetBackgroundImage()</A> The arguments specify file-name, how
 the image should be positioned in the graph and finally the format of
 the image (if it is in JPG, PNG or GIF) format. If the format is
 specified as &quot;auto&quot; (the default) then the appropriate image format
 will be determined from the extension of the image file.</P>
<P> The file name is of course obvious but the second argument might not
 be. This arguments determine how the image should be copied onto the
 graph image. You can specify three different variants here</P>
<OL>
<LI> BGIMG_ COPY This will just copy the image unchanged onto the graph
 from the top left corner.</LI>
<LI> BGIMG_CENTER This will just copy the image unchanged onto the graph
 but it will center the image in the graph.</LI>
<LI> BGIMG_FILLFRAME This will scale the image to exactly fit the whole
 graph image.</LI>
<LI> BGIMG_FILLPLOT This will scale the image to exactly fit just the
 plot area of the graph.</LI>
</OL>
 You might often find yourself wanting to use a background image as a
 &quot;waterstamp&quot;. This usually means taking the original image, import it
 to some image editing program and then &quot;bleeching&quot; the color
 saturation, reducing the contrast and so on. Finally you save the
 modified image which you then use as a bacvkground image.
<P> This whole process can be automatically accomplished in JpGraph by
 using the method<A href="../ref/Graph.html#_GRAPH_ADJBACKGROUNDIMAGE">
 Graph::AdjBackgroundImage()</A> which allow you to adjust color
 saturation, brightness and contrast of the background image.</P>
<P> For example, in the image below I have used the settings</P>

 intrusive in the graph.</P>

<HR> <SMALL><STRONG> Sidenote:</STRONG> The background image used above
 is my primary means of summer transportation. A 1998 Triumph Tiger.
 This bike is a nice 900cc quarter-of-a-metric-ton on/off-road bike.
 This is one of the few bikes I found which I can ride comfortable in
 despite me being 6' 4''.</SMALL>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="6_17">6.17 Using a background gradient</A></H2>
 In addition to the background image you can also add a background color
 gradient. This gradient can be covering the entire graph, just the plot
 area or just the margins. This flexibility allows you to combine a
 background image with a background color gradient. You can for example
 use a background image in the plot area and a color gradient out in the
 margins.
<P> You specify a color gradient background by calling the<A href="../ref/Graph.html#_GRAPH_SETBACKGROUNDGRADIENT">
 Graph::SetBackgroundGradient()</A> method. All details are available in
 the class reference (follow the link above). We finally give a quick
 example on what kind of effect you can achieve using this feature.</P>

<P> Finally we like to mention that in the &quot;/utils/misc/&quot; directory you
 will find a small utility script called &quot;mkgrad.php&quot;. Running this
 script presents you with a UI that makes it a breeze to create a
 gradient image on it's own.</P>
<P> The UI for the utility is so obvious that we won't discuss it
 further, we just show it below. <IMG alt="The UI for the mkgrad.php utility"

<H2><A NAME="6_18">6.18 Using callbacks for Plot marks</A></H2>
 An interesting enhancement when using Plotmarks is the possibility to
 add a callback function to control the size and color of the plotmarks.
<P> This callback function will get called with the current Y-value (for
 the plotmark) as it's argument. As return value the callback function
 must return an array containing three (possible null) values. The
 values returned must be</P>
<OL>
<LI> Plot mark Weight</LI>
<LI> Plot mark Color</LI>
<LI> Plot mark Fill color</LI>
</OL>
 The exact meaning of the parameters will of course depend on the type
 of plot marks being used.
<P> The callback must be a global function and is installed with a call
 to<A href="../ref/PlotMark.html#_PLOTMARK_SETCALLBACK">
 PlotMark::SetCallback()</A></P>
<P> So for example to install a callback that changes the fill color for
 all marks with a (Y) value higher than 90 you could add the lines</P>
<P>
<!--?
$t='function MarkCallback($aVal) {
    if( $aVal -->
 90) $fcolor=&quot;red&quot; else $fcolor=&quot;&quot;; return array(&quot;&quot;,&quot;&quot;,$fcolor); }
 ... $plot-&gt;mark-&gt;SetCallback(&quot;MarkCallback&quot;); ...';
 ShowCodeSnippet($t); ?&gt;</P>
<P> As you can see in the above example we have left some of the return
 values blank. Doing this will just ignore any change of these value and
 use the global settings for the plotmarks.</P>
<P> If you also let the (Y) value affect the size of the plot marks you
 can get what is sometimes known as a &quot;balloon plot&quot;. The example below
 is basically a scatter plot that uses filled circles to mark the
 points. A format callback is then used to change the color and size
 depending on the Y-value for each plot.</P>

<H2><A NAME="6_19">6.19 Rotating graphs 90 degrees</A></H2>
 In section<A href="7adv.html#10_2"> 10.2</A> you can read about
 arbitrary rotation of the graphs. For most practical purposes rotation
 of 90 degrees is most usefull. This could for example be used to plot
 horizontal bar graphs.
<P> The slight complication with general rotation is that the margins
 also rotates, this means that if you rotate a graph 90 degrees the left
 margin in the image was originally the bottom margin. In additional by
 default the center of the rotation is the center of the plot area and
 not the entire image (if all the margins are symetrical then they will
 of course coincide). This means that depending on your margin the
 center of the rotation will move. You can read more about this and how
 to manually set the center for rotation in the sectin about rotation,<A href="7adv.html#10_2">
 10.2</A></P>
<P> This is just a slight inconvinience which you have to take into
 account when you need to set an explicit margin with a call to<A href="../ref/Graph.html#_GRAPH_SETMARGIN">
 Graph::SetMargin()</A></P>
<P> However, in order to make a rotation of 90 degrees much easier you
 can easily rotate a graph 90 degrees and set the correct margin with a
 call to<A href="../ref/Graph.html#_GRAPH_SET90ANDMARGIN">
 Graph::Set90AndMargin()</A> The parameter to this method lets you
 specify the margins as you will se them in the image without having to
 think of what becomes what after the rotation.</P>
<P> So, the only thing you need to do is call this method and then the
 graph will have been rotated 90 degrees.</P>
