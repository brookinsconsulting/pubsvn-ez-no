Installing [ExtensionName] extension
====================================

1. Copy the package into the `extension' directory in the root of your eZ publish installation.

2. Unpack the files in the distribution. The command necessary is depends on the file you 
   downloaded.
   [tar.gz]:
   $ tar -zxvf [ExtensionArchiveName]-extension-[ExtensionVersion].tar.gz
   [bz2]:
   $ tar -jxvf [ExtensionArchiveName]-extension-[ExtensionVersion].bz2
   [zip]:
   $ unzip [ExtensionArchiveName]-extension-[ExtensionVersion].zip

3. We must now enable the extension in eZ publish. To do this edit site.ini.append(.php) in the 
   folder root_of_ezpublish/settings. If this file does not exist; create it. Locate (or add)
   the block [ExtensionSettings] and add the line:

   ActiveExtensions[]=[ExtensionIdentifier]

   If you run several sites using only one distribution and only some of the sites should use
   the extension, make the changes in the override file of that siteaccess. 
   E.g root_of_ezpublish/settings/siteaccess/news/site.ini.append(.php)
   But instead of using ActiveExtensions you must add these lines instead:

   [ExtensionSettings]
   ActiveAccessExtensions[]=[ExtensionIdentifier]
