    Requirements: 
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    PHP 4.0.3 or higher (4.3.3 recommended)
    MySQL 3.23.3 or higher (InnoDB recommended)

    phpAdsNew is currently not tested against PHP 5 and definately not
    compatible with PHP 5 beta 1. We advise users to wait with upgrading
    to PHP 5 until it is officially released. Shortly before the official 
    release of PHP 5 we will release a version of phpAdsNew that will be
    compatible.

    If you want to run phpAdsNew on a PostgreSQL server you should
    take a look at phpPgAds, which is a port of phpAdsNew to PostgreSQL,
    made by Matteo Beccati. The phpPgAds project can be found at:
