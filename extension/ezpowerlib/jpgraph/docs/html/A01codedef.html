<H1><A NAME="13">13 Code defines in JpGraph</A></H1>
 Various settings in JpGraph are controilled by overall DEFINEs at the
 top of jpgraph.php. Most of these defines should not have to be changed
 by the regular user but left at their defualt values. Below is a
 complete table of all defines and their meaning.
<TABLE cellspacing="3" style="border:blue solid 2pt;">
<TR style="background-color:blue;color:white;"><TH>Define, default value</TH><TH>
Comment</TH></TR>
<TR><TD valign="top">&quot;CACHE_DIR&quot;,&quot;/tmp/jpgraph_cache/&quot;</TD><TD>The full
 absolute name of directory to be used as a cache. This directory<STRONG>
 must</STRONG> be readable and writable for PHP. Must end with '/'</TD></TR>
<TR><TD valign="top">&quot;TTF_DIR&quot;,&quot;/usr/local/fonts/ttf/&quot;</TD><TD>Directory
 for jpGraph TTF fonts. Must end with '/' Note: The fonts must follow
 the naming conventions as used by the supplied TTF fonts in JpGraph.</TD>
</TR>
<TR><TD valign="top">&quot;USE_LIBRARY_GD2&quot;,false</TD><TD>Specify if we
 should use GD 2.x or GD 1.x If you have GD 2.x installed it is
 recommended that you use it since it will give a slightly, slightly
 better visual apperance for arcs. If you don't have GD2 installed this
 must be set to false!</TD></TR>
<TR><TD valign="top">'USE_TRUECOLOR',true</TD><TD>Should the image be a
 truecolor image? Note 1: Can only be used with GD 2.0.2 and above. Note
 2: GD 2.0.1 + PHP 4.0.6 on Win32 crashes when trying to use trucolor.
 Truecolor support is to be considered alpha since GD 2.x is still not
 considered stable (especially on Win32). Note 3: MUST be enabled to get
 background images working with GD2 Note 4: If enabled then truetype
 fonts will look very ugly =&gt; You can't have both background images and
 truetype fonts in the same image until these bugs has been fixed in GD
 2.01</TD></TR>
<TR><TD valign="top">&quot;USE_CACHE&quot;,false</TD><TD>Should the cache be used
 at all? By setting this to false no files will be generated in the
 cache directory. The difference from READ_CACHE being that setting
 READ_CACHE to false will still create the image in the cache directory
 just not use it. By setting USE_CACHE=false no files will even be
 generated in the cache directory.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD valign="top">&quot;READ_CACHE&quot;,true</TD><TD>Should we try to find an
 image in the cache before generating it? Set this define to false to
 bypass the reading of the cache and always regenerate the image. Note
 that even if reading the cache is disabled the cached will still be
 updated with the newly generated image. Set also &quot;USE_CACHE&quot; below.</TD>
</TR>
<TR><TD valign="top">&quot;DEFAULT_GFORMAT&quot;,&quot;auto&quot;</TD><TD>Deafult graphic
 format set to &quot;auto&quot; which will automtically choose the best available
 format in the order png,gif,jpg (The supported format depends on what
 your PHP installation supports)</TD></TR>
<TR><TD valign="top">&quot;USE_IMAGE_ERROR_HANDLER&quot;,true</TD><TD> Determine
 if the error handler should be image based or purely text based. Image
 based makes it easier since the script will always return an image even
 in case of errors.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD valign="top">&quot;USE_APPROX_COLORS&quot;,true</TD><TD>If the color
 palette is full should JpGraph try to allocate the closest match? If
 you plan on using background image or gradient fills it might be a good
 idea to enable this. If not you will otherwise get an error saying that
 the color palette is exhausted. The drawback of using approximations is
 that the colors might not be exactly what you specified. Note1: This
 does only apply to paletted images, not truecolor images since they
 don't have the limitations of maximum number of colors.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD valign="top">&quot;LANGUAGE_CYRILLIC&quot;,false</TD><TD>Special unicode
 language support</TD></TR>
<TR><TD valign="top">&quot;ERR_DEPRECATED&quot;,false</TD><TD>Should usage of
 deprecated functions and parameters give a fatal error? (Useful to
 check if code is future proof.)</TD></TR>
<TR><TD valign="top">&quot;BRAND_TIMING&quot;,false</TD><TD>Should the time taken
 to generate each picture be branded to the lower left in corner in each
 generated image? Useful for performace measurements generating graphs</TD>
</TR>
<TR><TD valign="top">&quot;BRAND_TIME_FORMAT&quot;,&quot;Generated in: %01.3fs&quot;</TD><TD>
What format should be used for the timing string?</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<P> The following defines should very rarely need to be changed</P>
<P></P>
<TABLE cellspacing="3" style="border:blue solid 2pt;">
<TR style="background-color:blue;color:white;"><TH>Define, default value</TH><TH>
Comment</TH></TR>
<TR><TD valign="top">&quot;CACHE_FILE_GROUP&quot;,&quot;wwwadmin&quot;</TD><TD>What group
 should the cached file belong to (Set to &quot;&quot; will give the default group
 for the &quot;PHP-user&quot;) Please note that the Apache user must be a member
 of the specified group since otherwise it is impossible for Apache to
 set the specified group.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD valign="top">&quot;CACHE_FILE_MOD&quot;,0664</TD><TD>What permissions
 should the cached file have (Set to &quot;&quot; will give the default
 persmissions for the &quot;PHP-user&quot;)</TD></TR>
<TR><TD valign="top">&quot;USE_BRESENHAM&quot;,false</TD><TD>Decide if we should
 use the bresenham circle algorithm or the built in Arc(). Bresenham
 gives better visual apperance of circles but is more CPU intensive and
 slower then the built in Arc() function in GD. Turned off by default
 for speed</TD></TR>
<TR><TD valign="top">&quot;JPG_DEBUG&quot;,false</TD><TD>Enable some extra
 internal debug information to be shown. (Should only be changed if your
 first name is Johan and you happen to know what you are doing. You have
 been warned.)</TD></TR>
<TR><TD valign="top">&quot;_CSIM_SPECIALFILE&quot;,&quot;_csim_special_&quot;</TD><TD>
Special file name to indicate that we only want to calc the image map in
 the call to Graph::Stroke() used internally from the GetHTMLCSIM()
 method.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD valign="top">&quot;_CSIM_DISPLAY&quot;,&quot;_jpg_csimd&quot;</TD><TD>HTTP GET
 argument that is used with image map to indicate to the script to just
 generate the image and not the full CSIM HTML page.</TD></TR>
