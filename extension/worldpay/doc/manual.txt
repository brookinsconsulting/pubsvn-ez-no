# Worldpay Module manual

ADDING THE EXTENSION TO EZ
-----------------------------------------------------

#INI files to set

File: site.ini

[ExtensionSettings]
ExtensionDirectory=extension
ActiveExtensions[]=worldpay

File: workflow.ini.append.php ** Note we are not 100% sure if this is needed but add it anyway.

# get workflow events from the extension when it's turned on.
[EventSettings]
ExtensionDirectories[]=worldpay

#Worldpay.ini file settings

Price difference is the difference from the orignal price when exchange rates are calculated
Password is the password you set in worlpay admin to ensure that the http call us worldpay.

#User settings

The file 'worldpaytype.php' requires the user class to contain the correct attributes. These are, in order:

Datatype | Name

Text line - First name
Text line - Last name
User account - User account
Text line - Company name
Matrix - Address
Text line - Telephone Number
Country - Country

Within 'worldpaytype.php' this is defined as:

define( "VWT_FIRST_NAME", 0 );
define( "VWT_LAST_NAME", 1 );
define( "VWT_USER", 2 );
define( "VWT_COMPANY", 3 );
define( "VWT_ADDRESS", 4 );
define( "VWT_TEL", 5 );
define( "VWT_COUNTRY", 6 );

If you want to add a special shop user read these instructions:

http://ez.no/developer/ez_publish_3/documentation/incoming/tutorial_using_userregister

If you do not then modify your user class to include these attributes. Note, 'Country' is an unpublished
datatype but it is based on the ezcountry datatype within the contributions. Publication may happen soon. To
get around this you can just use a Text line attribute.

#What does this module not include

checks for fraud, subscription payments, only standard single transaction payment is accepted.

WORKFLOW PROCESS
---------------------------------------
1. Shopper adds items to basket
2. Shopper clicks view basket - This show user basket
3. Shopper clicks confirm order - This run /shop/checkout which kicks off worldpaytype workflow
4. worldpaytype.tpl has post data which it it Javascript refreshes to worldpay site
5. Shopper enters credit card details in Worldpay site
6. Worldpay sends transaction data view HTTP to /worldpay/checkout
7. callback.php checks to ensure all is in order, if it is it automatically completes the workflow and returns the orderview for the order.

FUTURE WORK
--------------------------

* Improve xrate.ini download script as if the wget fails it does not inform anyone and it prevents payment from site.
* Improve basket clearing routine, the basket should only be cleared on a sucessful transation. At the moment it is cleared when the first pass worldpay workflow is run.
* Store extra reporting data and create reports.
* Store IP address of ordering client to help reduce fraud
